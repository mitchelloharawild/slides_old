# gganimate - animating ggplot2’s grammar of graphics

## OnePackagePerMeetup - Tunis R User Group

Animation is a powerful storytelling tool for your data analysis that
bridges the gap between static and interactive visualisations to provide
a guided exploration of the data. The gganimate package extends the
widely used and much loved ggplot2 package, and introduces a grammar for
animation that integrates seamlessly with the grammar of graphics. This
workshop will guide you through the world of animated data
visualisation. We’ll discuss when and why animation should be used, and
how to extend your plots with animation. Come along with an idea for a
plot you’d like to animate, as there will be some time to try gganimate
for yourself.
