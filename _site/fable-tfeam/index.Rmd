.title[tsibble]

* A modern temporal data structure
* Provides tools for time-related analysis
* Integrates seamlessly with the tidyverse

<br>

More information:

* `r fa("github", fill = "white")` [tidyverts/tsibble](https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble)
* `r fa("globe", fill = "white")` [tsibble site](https://pkg.earo.me/tsibble/)
* `r fa("desktop", fill = "white")` [NY Meetup](http://slides.earo.me/bigapple/) & [useR!2018](http://slides.earo.me/useR18/)

???

tsibble is the base for fable, providing a modern data structure for time series.
Note that a whole talk can be (and has been) made just about tsibble!
Check the links for more details

---

## A simple example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tsibbledata::ausretail
```

.footnote[Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics. Catalogue No. 8501.0]

???

Features:

* Monthly observations
* One response variable
* >64,000 rows
* Turnover in $M AUD
* 152 individual series (by State and Industry)

---

## Victorian cafe and restaurant turnover

```{r, echo=TRUE}
vic_cafe <- tsibbledata::ausretail %>%
  filter(State == "Victoria", Industry == "Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services")
```
```{r cafe-plot}
vic_cafe %>%
  autoplot(Turnover) +
  ggtitle("Victorian cafe, restaurant and takeaway turnover") +
  ylab("Turnover ($Million AUD)")
```

???

Focus on Victorian cafes and restaurants (why? vic loves coffee + food)
Detail patterns in data (trend, multiplicative seasonality, noise)
---

## Half-hourly electricity demand data

```{r elecdemand, echo = TRUE}
tsibbledata::elecdemand
```

.footnote[Source: Australian Energy Market Operator, and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology]

???

* Data contains only one series (no keys), with 3 variables
* > 17500 rows
* Data is for 2014, with half-hourly data
* We want to forecast Demand.

---

### Electricity demand (Monthly)
```{r elecMonthly}
mp4_vid("resources/anim1.mp4")
```

???

cafe dataset was monthly - if elec demand was monthly it'd look like this.
Annual seasonal pattern is evident - winter and summer has high demand

---

### Electricity demand (Daily)
```{r elecDaily}
mp4_vid("resources/anim2.mp4")
```

???

data isn't monthly, if instead it were daily we see more patterns
annual pattern remains, but now there is a working day / not working day pattern
also, we start to see noise

---

### Electricity demand (Half-hourly)
```{r elecPlot}
mp4_vid("resources/anim3.mp4")
```

???

data is actually half-hourly, when plotting this there is too much to see!
---

### Electricity demand (Half-hourly)
```{r elecPlotZoom}
mp4_vid("resources/anim4.mp4")
```

???

zooming in, we see half-hourly detail.
reveals a third seasonal pattern that changes within days
people demand more electricity when awake, and with peaks in morning and afternoon
weekend pattern is similar, with a less extreme peak in the morning (relaxed waking hours)

.title[Model]

## Model specification and estimation

`ETS(tsibble, formula, ...)`

`ARIMA(tsibble, formula, ...)`

`TSLM(tsibble, formula, ...)`

and many more...

???

Before forecasting - we need a model
at minimum, a model requires a tsibble and a model formula
in this talk, we'll be modelling with ETS, ARIMA, and TSLM

---

## Model specification - with formulas

Using a formula is a concise method of model specification, and is used in most modelling functions in R. Use of a formula is rare in time series modelling, leading to complicated documentation and verbose interfaces.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
transformation(y) ~ trend() + season(period = "day") + x
```

???

formulas are common in regression models, but not in time series
formulas are concise and human readable

--

.pull-left[

### LHS: Response
* Defines the data's response variable
* Specification of transformations
  (with automatic back-transformation)
]

???

also mention bias adjustments

--

.pull-right[

### RHS: Specials
* Model specific special functions
* Exogenous regressors
]

???

discuss with reference to the example formula above

---

## A basic model

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fit, echo = TRUE}
fbl_cafe_fit <- vic_cafe %>%
  fable::ETS(Turnover ~ season("M"))
```
```{r ets-fit-print, dependson='ets-fit'}
fbl_cafe_fit
```


]
]

???

response is Turnover
recap why we're using multiplicative seasonality here
specials not specified (error(), trend()) are automatically chosen to be "M" and "Ad"

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fc-fit, echo = TRUE}
fc_fit <- ts(vic_cafe$Turnover, start = c(1982, 4), frequency = 12) %>%
  forecast::ets("ZZM")
```
```{r ets-fc-fit-print, output.lines = 1:10, dependson='etc-fc-fit'}
fc_fit
```

]
]

???

here's the same model in forecast would be produced
notice the unnatural interface for creating a `ts`!

This is frustrating when your data already contains a time column and is prone to errors!
What is your data had missing values? gaps? ahh!

---

## Modelling with transformations

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fit-log, echo = TRUE}
vic_cafe %>%
  fable::ETS(log(Turnover) ~ season("A"))
```

]
]

???

transformations in fable are natural
like forecast, they will be automatically back transformed
note that we now want additive seasonality as logs of multiplicative components gives additive components

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fc-fit-log, echo = TRUE, output.lines = 1:10}
ts(vic_cafe$Turnover, start = c(1982, 4), frequency = 12) %>%
  forecast::ets("ZZA", lambda = 0)
```
]
]

???

forecast only supports BoxCox transformations, and you need to know that lambda=0 is a log

fable also supports combinations transformations, such as log(Turnover + 1) for data with low counts and zeroes!

---

## Using exogenous information

```{r elecdemand-xreg, fig.height=5}
tsibbledata::elecdemand %>%
  gather("Series", "Value", Demand, Temperature) %>%
  mutate(Series = recode(Series, "Demand" = "Demand (GW)", "Temperature" = "Temperature (C)")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=index, y=Value, group=Series)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(Series ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(NULL) +
  ggtitle("Electricity demanded and temperature") +
  geom_smooth()
```

???

fable makes xreg easy
elecdemand is strongly driven by temperature

---

## Modelling with exogenous regressors

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fit, echo = TRUE}
tsbl_elec <- tsibbledata::elecdemand %>% filter(index < ymd("2014-03-01"))
fbl_elec_fit <- tsbl_elec %>%
  fable::ARIMA(Demand ~ WorkDay + Temperature + I(Temperature^2) +
               pdq(1,0,1) + PDQ(1,1,1, period = "day"))
```
```{r arima-fit-print, dependson='arima-fit'}
fbl_elec_fit
```

]
]

???

need to use ARIMA instead of ETS here, as ETS does not support xreg
xreg can be added to model formula directly
brief note about pdq being non-seasonal and PDQ being seasonal

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fc-fit, echo = TRUE}
ts_elec <- ts(head(fpp2::elecdemand, 2832), frequency = 48)
fc_elec_fit <- ts_elec[,"Demand"] %>%
  forecast::Arima(order = c(1,0,1), seasonal = c(1,1,1),
                  xreg = cbind(ts_elec[,c("WorkDay", "Temperature")],
                               ts_elec[,"Temperature"]^2))
```
```{r arima-fc-fit-print, dependson='arima-fc-fit'}
fc_elec_fit
```
]
]

???

xreg with forecast is not pretty!
manipulating the time series object can be hard (no date comparisons here!) and xregs must be specified as a numerical matrix

BUT!
The forecast output is more informative, we see some coefficients and other interesting things
In fable, we only see the selected model

.title[Extract]

## Extract model information using tidy functions

`augment(mable, ...)`

`tidy(mable, ...)`

`glance(mable, ...)`

`components(mable, ...)`

???

to access this extra model information we use tidy verbs
fable introduces the components verb which extracts model components (such as states from ETS)

---

# Augment tsibble with model fits (broom::augment)

```{r ets-augment, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
augment(fbl_cafe_fit)
```

???

adds fitted model information to the model data

---

# Tidy model parameters (broom::tidy)

```{r ets-tidy, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
tidy(fbl_cafe_fit)
```

???

accesses model coefficients in a tidy format

---

# Glance a one-row model summary (broom::glance)
```{r ets-glance, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
glance(fbl_cafe_fit)
```

???

reveals useful model diagnostics such as AIC, sigma, etc.

---

# Extract model components (fable::components)
```{r ets-components, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
components(fbl_cafe_fit)
```

???

these components are particularly interesting to plot

---

# Extract model components (fable::components)
```{r ets-components-plot, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
components(fbl_cafe_fit) %>%
  gather(component, value, level, slope, season) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(component), scales = "free_y")
```

???

---
class: inverse

.sticker-float[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]

.title[Forecast]

## Forecast future values

`forecast(mable, new_data, h, ...)`

???

Now that we've fitted our model, how do we get our forecasts?
Can use either new_data or h, h is easier, new_data is more precise and supports xreg

---

## Producing forecasts

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fc-log, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
fbl_cafe_fc <- fbl_cafe_fit %>% forecast(h=24)
```
```{r ets-fc-log-print, output.lines = 1:8, dependson='ets-fc-log'}
fbl_cafe_fc
```
]
]

???

quickly here!

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fc-fc-log, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fc'}
fc_fc <- fc_fit %>% forecast(h=24)
```
```{r ets-fc-fc-log-print, output.lines = 1:8, dependson='ets-fc-fc-log'}
fc_fc
```
]
]

???

same interface.
you'll find once you have your model fitted, the interface is consistent for all models

Note the difference between intervals and distribution.
Storing distribution allows us to compute any interval without re-computing forecasts

---

## Producing forecasts

```{r ets-fc-log-plot, echo = TRUE}
fbl_cafe_fc %>% autoplot(vic_cafe)
```

???

Can't show a table of forecasts without looking at them too!
Forecasts look reasonable.

---

## Producing forecasts with new data

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fc, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fit'}
tsbl_elec_new <- tsibbledata::elecdemand %>%
  filter(index >= ymd("2014-03-01"), index < ymd("2014-03-14"))
fbl_elec_fc <- fbl_elec_fit %>%
  forecast(tsbl_elec_new)
```
```{r arima-fc-print, output.lines = 1:6, dependson='arima-fc'}
fbl_elec_fc
```
]
]

???

Forecasting with new data is easy in fable, just provide a tsibble that contains the necessary xregs

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fc-fc, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fc-fit'}
ts_elec_new <- ts(fpp2::elecdemand[2833:3456,], start = 60, frequency = 48)
fc_elec_fc <- fc_elec_fit %>%
  forecast:::forecast.Arima(h=24, xreg = cbind(
    ts_elec_new[,c("WorkDay", "Temperature")], ts_elec_new[,"Temperature"]^2))
```
```{r arima-fc-fc-print, output.lines = 1:8, dependson='arima-fc-fc'}
fc_elec_fc
```
]
]

???

this is a bit difficult with forecast, as you need to construct the xreg matrix yourself precisely!
Also note the time output in forecast vs fable! So many decimals!

---

## Producing forecasts with new data

```{r arima-fc-plot, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fc'}
fbl_elec_fc %>% autoplot(tsbl_elec)
```

???

again, need to show the plot!

---
class: inverse

.sticker-float[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]

.title[Accuracy]

## Accuracy evaluation to compare models

`accuracy(mable, measures, ...)`

`accuracy(fable, new_data, measures, ...)`

???

accuracy can be computed using on a model (in sample) or forecast (out of sample)
When evaluating forecasts, you must provide new data

fable adds the flexibility to specify a list of accuracy measures!
Meaning you can remove measures you don't want, add the ones you do, and even specify your own accuracy measure functions

---

## Evaluating model accuracy

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-accuracy-log, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
fbl_cafe_fit %>% accuracy()
```
]
]

???
quickly

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r ets-fc-accuracy-log, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fc-fit'}
fc_fit %>% forecast::accuracy()
```
]
]

???
identical interface
fable keeps contextual information from the keys

---

## Evaluating forecast accuracy

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![fable](resources/fable.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fc-accuracy, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fc'}
fbl_elec_fc %>% accuracy(tsbl_elec_new)
```
]
]

--

<hr>

.flex-row[
.sticker-left[![forecast](resources/forecast.svg)]
.flex-col[
```{r arima-fc-fc-accuracy, echo = TRUE}
fc_elec_fc %>% forecast::accuracy(ts_elec_new[,"Demand"])
```
]
]

???

interface is similar, although forecast requires you to specify a univariate time series to compare against
forecast provides both training and test accuracy here, despite only providing forecasts (can be confusing)

# Forecasting with tables

```{r recap-simple-fit, echo = TRUE}
fbl_cafe_fit
```

???

reiterate the package name - fable is for forecasting with tables
there's a reason why this output is a bit suspicious, a table containing one model?

--

```{r recap-ausretail, echo = TRUE}
tsibbledata::ausretail
```

???

but our dataset is a time series containing 152 series!
if only we could forecast them all?

---

# Estimate

```{r batch-ets, echo = TRUE}
retail_ets <- tsibbledata::ausretail %>%
  ETS(Turnover)
```
```{r batch-ets-print, dependson='batch-ets'}
retail_ets
```

???

that's exactly what we can do!
fable naturally supports batch forecasting for each series
we now have 152 models, using the same code as before

here we haven't specified any model specials, so everything is automatically selected
the first model is slightly different from the rest

---

# Extract (broom::augment)

```{r batch-augment, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
augment(retail_ets)
```

???

quickly through extract functions

We can extract model fits and residuals with augments

---

# Extract (broom::tidy)

```{r batch-tidy, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
tidy(retail_ets)
```

???

Look at the fitted coefficients

---

# Extract (broom::glance)
```{r batch-glance, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
glance(retail_ets)
```

???

See the model summary statistics

---

# Extract (fable::components)
```{r batch-components, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
components(retail_ets)
```

???

and view the components
this is particularly interesting to visualise

---

# Extract (fable::components)

```{r batch-components-plot, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
components(retail_ets) %>%
  filter(Industry == "Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = level, colour = State)) +
  geom_line()
```

???

here is the level state from all of the AUS for cafe/restaurant turnover
We can see without seasonality that NSW has highest turnover, followed by VIC.

---

# Forecast

```{r batch-fc, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
retail_fc <- retail_ets %>%
  forecast(h=24)
```
```{r batch-fc-print, dependson='batch-fc'}
retail_fc
```

???
to forecast the models is just as easy!
here we are forecasting 24 steps ahead from the last observation of each series

---

```{r batch-fc-plot, fig.height=7, dependson='batch-fc'}
tsibbledata::ausretail %>%
  filter(year(Month) >= 2000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Month, y=Turnover, colour = State)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Industry, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_forecast(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, level = level),
                fortify(retail_fc) %>% filter(year(Month) >= 2000), stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Turnover ($Million AUD)")
```

???
incase you don't believe it because the code is so simple... here's the proof
All 152 forecasts plotted with 80% and 95% intervals

Very hard to see/visualise this many series, so let's focus on the cafe industry

---

```{r batch-fc-cafe-plot, fig.height=7, dependson='batch-fc'}
tsibbledata::ausretail %>%
  filter(Industry == "Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Month, y=Turnover, colour = State)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Industry, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_forecast(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, level = level),
                fortify(retail_fc) %>% filter(Industry == "Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services"), stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Turnover ($Million AUD)")
```

???

Good separation of series, the forecasts for each series appears reasonable

---

# Evaluate

```{r batch-accuracy, echo = TRUE, dependson='batch-ets'}
retail_ets %>% accuracy()
```

???

accuracy evaluation is just as easy
scale independent measures such as MAPE and MASE are more meaningful here for comparison (as each series is on different scales)

.title[Extending fable]

???

so that's the core functionality of fable so far, we're working steadily to introduce new things.

fable is designed to be a modelling ecosystem rather than just one package.

## fable is extensible by design

Extension packages can:

* Define new transformations
* Provide new accuracy measures
* Introduce new models

Which will then be usable with all other transformations, measures and models!

here is the zoomed in electricity demand data

## Switching seasonality

```{r fasster-switching, fig.height = 6}
tsibbledata::elecdemand %>%
  filter(month(index) == 6) %>%
  mutate(
    `Working Day` = ifelse(WorkDay == 1, Demand, NA),
    `Non-working Day` = ifelse(WorkDay == 0, Demand, NA)
  ) %>%
  gather("Day Type", "Demand", `Working Day`, `Non-working Day`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=index, y = Demand, colour = `Day Type`)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("Electricity Demanded (GW)") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

???

remember, we saw a separate daily pattern for working days and non working days
our arima model didn't perform very well because it didn't capture this pattern

this pattern is common in most sub-daily time series, which are becoming more common!

---

# Forecasting with fasster

```{r, fasster-elecfit, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fit'}
fasster_fit <- tsbl_elec %>%
  fasster(log(Demand) ~ WorkDay %S% (trig(48, 16) + poly(1)) + Temperature + I(Temperature^2))
```

```{r fasster-elecfit-print}
fasster_fit
```

???

fasster uses the same model interface as fable
I've chosen to use a log transformation, which will be automatically back transformed by fable

My formula specification includes trig seasonality for the daily pattern, and a level, which switches for working and non-working days.
I've also included Temperature and Temperature^2 as xregs

--

```{r fasster-elecfc, echo = TRUE, dependson='fasster-elecfit'}
fasster_fc <- fasster_fit %>%
  forecast(tsbl_elec_new)
```

```{r fasster-elecfc-print, dependson='fasster-elecfc'}
fasster_fc
```

???
Once I've fitted the model, the function to get forecasts is identical to the ARIMA example.
We get our fable as a result (note that the distribution is transformed!)

---

# Forecasting with fasster
```{r fasster-elecfc-plot, echo = TRUE, dependson=c('fasster-elecfc','arima-fc')}
fasster_fc %>%
  autoplot(tsbl_elec)
```

???

the forecasts look much better than ARIMA, as the model is better specified to capture the data patterns.

# A peek into the future of fable!

???

Lot's of new features are planned.
All of the code/examples presented here is implemented and usable.

---

## `simulate()` future paths

```{r vic-cafe-sim, echo = TRUE, dependson='ets-fit'}
set.seed(20181108)
vic_cafe_sim <- fbl_cafe_fit %>%
  simulate(h = 24, times = 5)
```
```{r vic-cafe-sim-print, dependson='vic-cafe-sim'}
vic_cafe_sim
```

???

simulating data is a nice way to present the uncertainty in forecasts
here we're using the vic_cafe ETS model and simulating 24 steps ahead 5 times

---

## `simulate()` future paths

```{r vic-cafe-sim-plot, echo = TRUE, dependson='vic-cafe-sim'}
vic_cafe %>%
  filter(year(Month) >= 2010) %>%
  autoplot(Turnover) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .sim, group = .rep), alpha = 0.3, data = vic_cafe_sim)
```

???

from the simulation you can see substantial uncertainty.
the seasonal pattern is still evident.

---

## `interpolate()` missing values

.float-left[
```{r olympic-running, echo = TRUE}
tsibbledata::olympic_running
```
]

.plot-right-absolute[
```{r olympic-running-miss, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}
library(tsibbledata)
olympic_running %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y = Time, colour = Sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ Length, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  ylab("Running time (seconds)")
```
]

.footnote[Source: The International Olympic Committee ([www.olympic.org](www.olympic.org))]

???

Missing values are especially relevant for modern time series datasets
if you observe things more frequently, there is a higher chance something will go wrong

This data is the fastest running time from the olympics (men and women, 100m-10,000m)
The data has missing values in 1916, 1940, and 1944 due to the world wars.

---

## `interpolate()` missing values

.float-left[
```{r olympic-interpolated, echo = TRUE}
olympic_complete <- olympic_running %>%
  TSLM(Time ~ trend()) %>%
  interpolate(olympic_running)
```
```{r olympic-interpolated-print, echo = FALSE, dependson='olympic-interpolated'}
olympic_complete
```
]

.plot-right-absolute[
```{r olympic-running-completed, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, dependson='olympic-interpolated'}
olympic_running %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y = Time, colour = Sex)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = "Interpolated"), data = olympic_complete) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = "Actual")) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ Length, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  ylab("Running time (seconds)")
```
]

???

model based interpolation in fable is easy.
here we've fitted a LM with linear trend, and used it to interpolate the data.

---

# `refit()` and `stream()` new data

`refit()` allows a model to be applied to a new dataset.

`stream()` allows a model to be extended using new data.

???

similar functions in that they modify a model to suit new data.

--

Models parameters can be re-estimated (could be time consuming) or not.

---

# `stream()` new data

```{r fasster-fc-recall, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fasster_fc
```

```{r fasster-fc-recall-plot}
tsbl_elec_newer <- tsibbledata::elecdemand %>%
  filter(index >= ymd("2014-03-14"), index < ymd("2014-04-01"))
fasster_fc %>% autoplot(tsbl_elec) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Electricity Demanded (GW)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  xlim(c(min(tsbl_elec$index), max(tsbl_elec_newer$index))) +
  ylim(c(1.95, 9.75))
```

???

earlier, we fitted a fasster model to electricity demand and got these forecasts

---

# `stream()` new data

```{r stream-newdata-code, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tsbl_elec_new
```

```{r stream-data}
tsbl_elec %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = Demand)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = "Model data")) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = "Streaming data"), data = tsbl_elec_new) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Electricity Demanded (GW)") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  xlim(c(min(tsbl_elec$index), max(tsbl_elec_newer$index))) +
  ylim(c(1.95, 9.75))
```

???

well, two weeks later we've gotten more data!
normally to include this new information we would need to re-estimate the full model again (could be time consuming!)

---

# `stream()` new data

```{r fasster-stream, echo = TRUE}
fasster_stream <- fasster_fit %>% stream(tsbl_elec_new)
```

```{r fasster-stream-fc-plot}
fasster_stream %>%
  forecast(tsbl_elec_newer) %>%
  autoplot(rbind(tsbl_elec, tsbl_elec_new)) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Electricity Demanded (GW)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  ylim(c(1.95, 9.75))
```

???

using stream(), we update the fitted model to include the new data, without needing to re-estimate the full model.

---

# Decomposition forecasting

```{r stl-decomposition, echo = TRUE}
library(tsibblestats)
cafe_dcmp <- vic_cafe %>%
  STL(log(Turnover))
```

```{r stl-decomposition-print}
cafe_dcmp
```

???

decompositions are also a useful forecasting technique
in forecast, stl forecasting is possible

in fable, there are plans to be able to forecast the components from any decomposition
here we have decomposed the cafe data using STL
the dable knows how to recombine components to get the original forecast

---

# Decomposition forecasting

```{r stl-decomposition-plot, fig.height=5.5}
cafe_dcmp %>%
  gather(component, value, trend, season_year, remainder) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(fct_rev(component) ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("Victorian cafe, restaurant and takeaway turnover") +
  ylab("Turnover ($Million AUD)")
```

???

here's a plot of those components.

Providing new decomposition functions is another way that fable can be extended

---

# Interval and distribution accuracy

Winker's score for interval accuracy:
$$W(\ell_t,u_t,y_t) = \begin{cases} (u_t-\ell_t) & \ell_t < y_t < u_t \\
    (u_t-\ell_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(\ell_t-y_t) & y_t < \ell_t \\
    (u_t-\ell_t) + \frac{2}{\alpha}(y_t-u_t) & y_t > u_t.\end{cases}$$

Percentile scoring for distribution accuracy:
$$L(q_{i,t}, y_t) = \begin{cases} (1 - i/100) (q_{i,t} - y_t) & y_t< q_{i,t}\\
	  (i/100) (y_t - q_{i,t}) & y_t\ge q_{i,t}.\end{cases}$$

???

Evaluating the accuracy of prediction intervals is also possible in fable.
Currently two measures are supported, winker's for interval accuracy and percentile for distributions

---

# Interval and distribution accuracy

```{r accuracy-new, echo = TRUE, dependson='arima-fc'}
fbl_elec_fc %>%
  accuracy(
    new_data = tsbl_elec_new,
    measures = list(winkler = winkler_score, percentile = percentile_score)
  )
```

???

You can use them by adding them to the accuracy measures.

---

# More modelling methods

- BATS/TBATS
- DSHW
- NNAR
- THETA
- CROSTON
- Structural models (StructTS)

--

(any many more...)

???

There are many more modelling functions available in forecast left to add into fable.
fable will keep growing and getting better
